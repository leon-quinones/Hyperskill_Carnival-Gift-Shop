# Hyperskill Carnival-Gift-Shop
The Carnival Gift Shop (CGS) project is a fun and nice way to pratice javascript's basics including objects and functions definition, loops and conditional structures. In this project you are in charge of design a basic javascript program than mocks  avending machine's user interface and you have to accomplish it considering the client's (changing XD) requirements.

This repo only contains the fifth and last stage of the project. So take a look in my code. Thanks for watching
